    <h1>About Me - The Personal Side</h1>

    <p>
      Welcome to my personal space! This is where I share what I'm learning,
      reading, and exploring beyond my professional work.
    </p>

    <h2>ðŸ“š Bookshelf</h2>

    <p>
      I'm passionate about continuous learning and always have a few books on my
      reading list:
    </p>

    {
      personalData.currentBooks.map((book) => (
        <div class="book-item">
          <h3>{book.title}</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>by</strong> {book.author}
          </p>
          <p>{book.summary}</p>
        </div>
      ))
    }

    <h2>ðŸš€ Technologies I'm Learning</h2>

    <p>
      I believe in staying curious and exploring new technologies. Here's what
      I'm currently diving into:
    </p>

    {
      personalData.learningTech.map((tech) => (
        <div class="tech-item">
          <h3>{tech.name}</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Why I'm learning it:</strong> {tech.reason}
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Resources:</strong> {tech.resources.join(", ")}
          </p>
        </div>
      ))
    }

    <h2>ðŸŽ¯ Personal Interests</h2>

    <p>When I'm not coding, you'll find me:</p>

    <ul class="interests-list">
      {personalData.interests.map((interest) => <li>â€¢ {interest}</li>)}
    </ul>

    <h2>ðŸŒŸ Goals & Aspirations</h2>

    <p>Here are some things I'm working towards:</p>

    <ul class="goals-list">
      {personalData.goals.map((goal) => <li>â€¢ {goal}</li>)}
    </ul>

    <h2>ðŸ’­ Random Thoughts</h2>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "The best way to learn is to teach. The best way to grow is to share."
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers, share knowledge, and
      learn from others. Whether it's discussing the latest tech trends, sharing
      book recommendations, or just having a casual conversation about life and
      code.
